### Key Architectural Decisions

**Separation of concerns across state layers**

State is split into three layers based on its nature:

- **Zustand store** — domain data only (`bookings`, `properties`). Persisted to localStorage. No UI state.
- **ModalContext** — global UI state for the modal (open/closed, mode, target booking). Ephemeral, not persisted.
- **useState in App** — local UI state (`searchQuery`, `selectedPropertyId`). Only needed within the component tree.

This keeps the store pure and makes each layer easier to test independently.

**Unified BookingForm**

A single `BookingForm` component handles both create and edit modes via a `mode` prop. This ensures validation parity between the two operations and avoids duplicated logic. The form receives `existingBooking` when editing, which pre-fills all fields and passes the booking ID to the overlap checker so it excludes itself.

**Overlap detection — defense in depth**

Overlap prevention has two layers:

1. **DatePicker** — already-booked dates are disabled via `excludeDates`, preventing most conflicts at the UI level before the user even submits.
2. **Submit handler** — `validateDateRange` is called again on submit as a safety net, in case the UI layer was somehow bypassed.

The core algorithm:

```ts
// Two ranges overlap when:
isBefore(start, existingEnd) && isAfter(end, existingStart);

// Strict operators intentionally allow adjacent bookings:
// checkout on June 15 + checkin on June 15 = allowed
```

**Hooks as the interface to the store**

Components never import the store directly. All store access goes through hooks (`useBookings`, `useProperties`). This keeps components decoupled from the state implementation and makes them easier to test with mocks.

**Styled Components — no Tailwind**

Styled Components was chosen as the sole styling solution. Mixing it with Tailwind would create inconsistency, some styles as components, others as utility classes inline. A single solution with a `ThemeProvider` and design tokens gives full consistency and is easier to maintain and discuss in a review.

### Testing Strategy

**Unit tests (Vitest + RTL)**

Focus on the two most critical areas:

- `dateUtils.test.ts` — 20+ tests covering every overlap scenario: partial left, partial right, containment, adjacent, same-day, cancelled bookings, and the edit exclusion case.
- `bookingStore.test.ts` — tests for all CRUD operations and selectors, with store state reset between each test via `beforeEach`.
- `BookingCard.test.tsx` — component tests covering rendering, interactions, and a snapshot test.
- `Modal.test.tsx` — behavior tests for keyboard dismissal and aria attributes.

**E2E tests (Cypress)**

Full user flows verified in a real browser:

- Create, view, edit, and delete bookings
- Form validation errors
- Search and property filter
- Overlap prevention on submit
